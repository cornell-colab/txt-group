    "Today we will be introducing Python as a multipurpose tool for working with text. Python is a great language for jumping right into manipulating data, and using some of the creative techniques of programmatic thinking along the way.\n",

    "**Queying** is a method of requesting particular data from a larger collection or database, according to a set of conditions or **parameters** that are meaningful to us. Search queries are the underlying technique behind search bars of all kinds, from [library catalog searches](http://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/) to Google's [new dataset search tool](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch). Queries also have a special use case in fetching data from a public API, which you can learn more about in this [workshop guide](https://github.com/cornell-colab/fetching-data-from-apis).\n",
