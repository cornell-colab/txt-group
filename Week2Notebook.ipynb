Much the way that making a pizza bagel in the microwave resembles cooking a neopolitan pizza in a handmade wood-fired oven, this exercise is designed to coveinently give you the flavor and general idea of these concepts rather than offer an intensive explanation of their mechancis.\n\nSome general advice, particularly when using __for__ and __if__ statements is to routinely __print()__ your work thus far. If, for instance, I'm receiving coding errors that tell me that I can't iterate using a string, I'll want to print what token is in for token in poormans_tokens:"
