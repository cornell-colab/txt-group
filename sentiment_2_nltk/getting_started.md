# Getting Started with NLTK

For this workshop we will rely on the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and Python. In the first part of the lesson, we will install NLTK and explore the VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer module using the Python interactive mode. In the second part, you will explore one of multiple corpuses of poems/letters and use sentiment to guide your way!

To get started, let's follow along with [this lesson](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sentiment-analysis) on NLTK sentiment analysis from Programming Historian.
