The second line issues a **command**.\n\nThe **print** command above is asking Python to return the contents of the list tp_Flavors. Since the list is empty currently, it returns an empty list.\n\n## Data Types\n\nHow do we computationally represent toaster pastry flavors? If a friend asked you what flavor of toaster pastry you wanted for breakfast, which of the following answers would make the most sense:\n1.) True\n2.) 1.97\n3.) 5\n4.) \"strawberry\"\n\nThe context of your friend's question is important here. If their question was whether or not you liked toaster pastries, option 1 would be the best way to communicate. **Bools** or booleans are a datatype that returns whether a condition is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nIf your friend's question was how much a toaster pastry was before tax, option 2 would be the best way to communicate. Since your friend is asking for an exact measurement a **Float** or floating point number (more specifically a double-precision floating point number) provides digits accurate to the fifteenth to seventeenth decimal place.\n\nIf your friend's question was how many toaster pastries you think you could eat until you were ill, option 3 would be the best way to communicate. While it may be that 4.5768 toaster pastries exactly are what move the gastrointestinal needle from saiety to sickness, **Integers** provide representations of whole numbers that are important for determining how many intervals or loops you want a command to run.\n\nIn this instance, however, your friend has only asked you what your favorite flavor is. While one could, in theory, represent a flavor with a series of floating point numbers, in this context it would be most helpful to offer a **String** of characters. Strings are alphanumeric representations of characters. Or, to put it more simply, strings are the most common representation of text.\n\nBelow, I will illustrate each of these data types. If you run these commands, they will illustrate some of what is described above."
